### Community supported agriculture
Community supported agriculture (CSA) is a partnership between farmers and consumers in which the responsibilities, risks and rewards of farming are shared.

### About

We are a market garden just outside moneyreagh Belfast. We grow a range of seasonal produce using Agro-ecological methods, this means we don’t use pesticides or synthetic fertilizers, we prefer to work with nature to foster a healthy soil that rewards us with beautiful plants that not only benefit our health but the planets as well.
A vegetable that arrives on your plate within a couple of hours of being picked is simply hard to beat. It’s tastes, well, like vegetables were meant to taste like. This is why we are passionate about growing real food that’s local and in season. 

Unfortunately we live in a world were allot of our food is now imported from a country hundreds of miles away. We believe there is another way.
