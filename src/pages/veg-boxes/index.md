   Wednesday afternoons?
   As we have other commitments outside of the farm, we will have to keep our delivery/collection days flexible. We will let you know 2 weeks in advance what day we will deliver. If this doesn’t suit, just let us know and we will endeavor to find a Day that works best for you.

      The first time I tried Kaldi’s coffee, I couldn’t even believe that was
      the same thing I’ve been drinking every morning.

      Kaldi is the place to go if you want the best quality coffee. I love their
      stance on empowering farmers and transparency.

   We are a market garden just outside moneyreagh Belfast. We grow a range of seasonal produce using Agro-ecological methods, this means we don’t use pesticides or synthetic fertilizers, we prefer to work with nature to foster a healthy soil that rewards us with beautiful plants that not only benefit our health but the planets as well.
   A vegetable that arrives on your plate within a couple of hours of being picked is simply hard to beat. It’s tastes, well, like vegetables were meant to taste like. This is why we are passionate about growing real food that’s local and in season. 

   Unfortunately we live in a world were allot of our food is now imported from a country hundreds of miles away. We believe there is another way.
